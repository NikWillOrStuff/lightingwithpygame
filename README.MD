A 2D lighting engine thingy, written in python, rendered using [pygame](pygame.org)

Only compatible with Python 3.8 and above (which pygame is not officially compatible with yet, but you can get compatible prereleases of pygame from their github [here](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/releases) and instructions installing those .whl files [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27909082))
